        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

        <h2 align="center" style="color:#38012a;">What Is This Library All About?</h2>
        <p align="center" style="color:#A8C077;">Serenity is a learning project of mine that was created for the sole
            purpose of being a starting point into creating a project that would be considered "complete".
            This Library takes as inspiration <a href="https://github.com/gabime/spdlog" style="color:azure;">spdlog</a>
            for its usage of user defined format patterns, its ability to swap out formatting backends,
            the ability to log to a terminal with and without color (similar to spdlog's ansicolor, wincolor, stdout,
            stdout_color sinks), the ability to log into a single file (equivalent to spdlog's basic file sink),
            as well as the ability to log using multiple files in a rotation basis (similar to spdlog's rotation based
            sinks such as the hourly, daily, and rotating_file sinks).
        </p>
        <p align="center" style="color:#A8C077;">
            Serenity also includes a native formatting backend in the form of <a
                href="https://github.com/USAFrenzy/ArgFormatter" style="color:azure;">ArgFormatter</a>. ArgFormatter is
            another project of mine that originally stemmed from this project - it's usage is a limited replacement for
            <a href="https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt" style="color:azure;">fmtlib</a> and
            <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format/format"
                style="color:azure;"><code>std::format</code></a>
            and covers all plain old data types, std::tm, as well as the ability to add custom formatting for full
            compatibility
            with the aforementioned formatters. In benching timings, "<code>ArgFormatter</code>" provides faster
            formatting times
            at the cost of not being as robust as the other two. We'll dive into this more later, but just know that you
            have the
            ability to swap this formatting backend out for either "<code>fmtlib</code>" or "<code>< format ></code>" if
            you so desire.
        </p>
        <p align="center" style="color:#A8C077;">
            Serenity is also fully Unicode supported through its usage of
            <a href="https://github.com/USAFrenzy/UTF-Utils" style="color:azure;">UTF-Utils</a> (this is another short
            header-only library
            I wrote initially specifically for Serenity). What this allows Serenity to do is take an input source from
            any encoding (barring
            big endian utf-16/utf-32; little endian is supported) and encodes it into utf-8 for internal usage in
            processing and formatting.
            Then, when it's time to actually log the message, Serenity will detect the char set of the container and
            encode it if need be.
            The included targets all use utf-8 compatible containers, however, if you the user decided to inherit from
            <code>TargetBase</code>,
            you could override the <code>PrintMessage()</code> function to log to almost any container.

        <h2 style="color:#38012a;">Serenity Requires The Following:</h2>
        <ul style="color:#A8C077;">
            <li>C++ 20</li>
            <ul>
                <li>lambda closure type</li>
                <li>lambda parameter pack expansions</li>
                <li>Aggregate initializations</li>
                <li>Heavy use of constraints and concepts</li>
                <li>Light usage of abbreviated function templates</li>
                <li><code>"< concepts >"</code> header</li>
                <li><code>"< format >"</code> header if the build option used replaces the native formatter backend</li>
                <li><code>"< source_location >" header</code></li>
                <li>Heavy usage of <code>std::remove_cvref_t<></code></li>
                <li><code>std::jthread</code></li>
                <li><code>std::stop_token</code></li>
                <li><code>std::stop_source</code></li>
            </ul>
            <li>A formatting backend:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><code>"ArgFormatter"</code> is the default backend. It uses build option <em>"USE_NATIVEFMT"</em>
                </li>
                <li><code>"fmtlib"</code>. It uses build option <em>"USE_FMTLIB"</em> and defaults to version 9.1.0</li>
                <li><code>"< format >"</code>. It uses build option <em>"USE_STDFMT"</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li><code>Utf-Utils</code> - this project is automatically included and linked in but is a hard requirement
            </li>
        </ul>
